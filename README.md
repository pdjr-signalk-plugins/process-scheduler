# signalk-process-scheduler

[Signal K Node Server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) plugin
which implements a simple process scheduler using the host notification system
as a control medium.

An arbitrary number of processes can be scheduled with each process modelled
as a three-phase life cycle consisting of a start phase followed by an iterative
phase and terminating with an end phase.  Any (or all) phases can be omitted
from scheduler control.

Each phase is characterised by a user-defined delay and duration.  The delay is
a period of quiescence before the controlled process is started, whilst duration
is the process execution time within the containing phase.

Scheduled control of a particular process is initiated by the appearance of one
or more user-defined ALERT notifications on the Signal K server bus.  Removal of
the notification (or its replacement by a non-ALERT variant) signals the scheduler
to relinquish process sheduling by entering the end phase of process control.

Signalk-process-scheduler was developed to control a stern gland lubrication
pump and this activity is configured in the following way:

1. Signal K's "engine start" data value is processed by signalk-threshold-notifier
into an "alert" notification signalling the process scheduler to start scheduling
the lubrication process.

2. The lubrication process is configured to consist of a start phase (delay = 0s,
duration = 300s) and an iterative phase (delay = 1800s, duration = 120s).  This
means that on engine start the lubrication pump will immediately run for five
minutes and will then run for two minutes every thirty minutes.

3. signalk-switchbank is used to translate the "run process" notifications issued
by the scheduler into NMEA 2000 PGN127502 messages which operate a relay controlling
the lube pump power supply.
## System requirements

__signalk-threshold-notifier__ has no special system requirements.
## Installation

Download and install __signalk-threshold-notifier__ using the _Appstore_ link
in your Signal K Node server console.

The plugin can also be downloaded from the
[project homepage](https://github.com/preeve9534/signalk-threshold-notifier)
and installed using
[these instructions](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/SERVERPLUGINS.md).
## Usage

 __signalk-process-scheduler__ is configured through the Signal K Node server
plugin configuration interface.
Navigate to _Server_->_Plugin config_ and select the _Process scheduler_ tab.

![Configuration panel](readme/config.png)

The plugin configuration consists of a list of scheduled processes each of which
is represented by a tab.  Clicking on a tab opens the configuration for the
selected process.

New processes can be added by clicking the __[+]__ button and any existing,
unwanted, processes can be deleted by clicking their adjacent __[x]__ button.

Each process configuration includes the following fields.

__Process name__  
A required text value which names the process.
There is no default value.

Enter here some text which identifies the process and which will make sense when
it appears in system log file messages.

__Notification path which enables this controller__  
One or more notification paths which will act as triggers for running the associated
process.Whether or not to process this rule.
Default value is yes (checked).

__Notification message__  
An optional text message which will be assigned to the message property of
all notifications generated by the rule.
The default value is a simple, automatically generated, message.

Enter here the text of the message you would like to be issued when the
monitored path value crosses one of the defined thresholds.
If the option is left blank then the plugin will insert just the monitored
path text as an identifier when it raises a notification.

Any of the following tokens may be used in the supplied message text and these
will be interpolated with the described value when the notification message is
composed.

_${path}_ will be replaced by the value of the _Monitored path_ option.

_${test}_ will be replaced by one of "above", "below" or "between" dependant
upon the threshold being crossed and the direction of crossing.

_${threshold}_ will be replaced with the value of the threshold triggering the
rule or, in the case of the path value being between thresholds with the
string "_n_ and _m_" where _n_ is the low threshold and _m_ is the high
threshold.

_${value}_ will be replaced with the instantaneous value of the monitored path
that triggered the rule.

_${vessel}_ will be replaced with Signal K's idea of the vessel name.

An example message text might be "${vessel}: ${path} is ${test} ${threshold} (currently ${value})".

__Path prefix__  
A notification path component which will be inserted after the "notifications."
root and before the value of _Monitored path_.
This allows semantic classification of notifications and supports overlapping
notifications on the same monitored path.
Default is "none" which places notifications directly under the "notifications."
root. 

__Low threshold__  
An optional numerical value which sets the lower threshold against which the
monitored path value will be compared.
The default value is a blank entry which disables monitoring of the low
threshold.

If a value is specified and the monitored path value falls below this limit
then a notification of the type defined by _Alarm state_ will be issued.

__Alarm state__  
A required value which will be assigned to the notification _state_ property
which is used to signal the severity of the notification.
Default is to set the alarm state to "alert".

Choose a value appropriate to the notification event.
Remember that notifications in Signal K may be processed by downstream handlers
and the chosen state could have significance elsewhere: an example is the
__signalk-switchbank__ plugin which treats "normal" and non-"normal" alarm
states as part of a switching signal.

__Suggested method__  
An optional value which will be assigned to the notification _method_ property
which is used to suggest to downstream notification handlers a preference for
how a notification may be handled.
Default is to express no preference.

Choose any values which you think appropriate, or none at all.
Once again, some downstream notification handlers may require a particular
value or combination of values in order to perform their function.

The cluster of options associated with defining a high threshold have similar
semantics to those described above: the __High threshold__ option itself,
naturally, defines an upper threshold against which the monitored path value
will be tested for a low-to-high transition.
## Use cases

__Stern gland lubrication__

_Beatrice_'s lubrication pump was originally connected directly to the engine ignition circuit and had a 100% duty cycle which was slowly and unnecessarily filling the engine-room bilge with grease.  I guessed that a duty cycle closer to 5% would be more than adequate and finally settled on a strategy of lubricating the prop shaft heavily at engine start and then with little bursts of lubrication whilst the engine was running.

To achieve this in hardware I required a process control timer module for my lubrication pump and since this was priced at 200 euros I thought maybe not.  I then considered using a cheap central-heating programmer but didn't like the inevitable awkwardness of this solution.

Since I happened to have an unused channel on my engine-room NMEA 2000 relay output module which could be used to modulate power to the lubrication pump all that was really needed was some Signal K logic to make things happen sensibly.  Using Signal K had the additional benefit of giving me access to data from my stern-gland temperature sensor as a subsidiary control mechanism.

This set the scene for the development of signalk-process-scheduler.  I use the plugin to solve the lubrication problem in the following way.

Scheduler control.  Some CAN/NMEA engine interfaces provide engine status directly to Signal K, but in my case an NMEA switchbank signal is associated with the main engine ignition switch position.  I use signalk-threshold-notifier to convert this switch signal into a Signal K ALERT notification which tells the scheduler to control the lubrication process: the scheduler runs the process when the ignition switch is in position I (RUN) and otherwise not.  I also use signalk-threshold-notifier to generate an ALERT notification when my stern gland temperature exceeds 60C.

In the scheduler, the lubrication process is configured with a start phase (delay = 0s, duration = 300s) and an iterative phase (delay = 1800s, duration = 120s). The intention here is that when the ignition switch is turned on the lubrication pump will immediately run for five minutes and will then run for two minutes every thirty minutes.

I chose to make the scheduler emit a 'notifications.control.shaftlubepump' ALERT notification to signal operation of the pump. This notification is translated into operation of the engine-room relay by signalk-switchbank which emits NMEA 2000 PGN127502 messages in response to changes in notification state.
